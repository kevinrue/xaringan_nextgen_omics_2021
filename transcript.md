## Slide 1 (cover)

Hello, and thank you for joining this short talk about iSEE, a Bioconductor package that provides a graphical user interface for the interactive and collaborative exploration of large-scale transcriptomics data.

My name is Kevin Rue-Albrecht. I am a computational biologist in the group of David Sims at the University of Oxford, and an instructor for the Oxford Biomedical Data Sience training programme.

## Slide 2

iSEE applications use the RStudio Shiny package to deliver interactive web-applications that can be accessed using any major web browser, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.
The graphical user interface includes a number of panels, each with a dedicated functionality, from dimensionality reduction results, to sample or gene metadata, or values from experimental assays.

iSEE applications feature a wide range of useful functionality.
One of the key features of iSEE is the ability of panels to select data points in some panels and transmit those selections to one or more other panels.

communicate and exchange selections of data points to one another.
