## Slide 1 (cover)

Hello, and thank you for joining this short talk about iSEE, a Bioconductor package that provides a graphical user interface for the interactive and collaborative exploration of large-scale transcriptomics data.

My name is Kevin Rue-Albrecht. I am a computational biologist at the University of Oxford and an instructor for the Oxford Biomedical Data Sience training programme, in the group of David Sims.
